# Advent of Koka
This is my attempt at doing 2022's Advent of Code in [Koka](https://koka-lang.github.io/koka/doc/index.html). My goal is to upload solutions for each day's problem on the day of release, but that might not happen.

I do not claim that any of these are the most efficient solutions. I'm making an effort to write reasonably efficient solutions, but the main goal of this exercise is to experience writing code in Koka.
